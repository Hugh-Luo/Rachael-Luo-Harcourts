# Rachael-Luo-Harcourts

This is my first project after finished the learning of courses of Web Development! 

From doing this, I learned a lot. Also, I made many mistakes. 

This project includes Node.js, React.js.

How to connect it backend and frontend and send the API of Mailchimp to add a contact in audience. 

In the end, I got stuck about how to put them on the heroku. 

Finally, the whole project finished~ ðŸ˜€
